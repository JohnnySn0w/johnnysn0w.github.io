Hello there! I'm Winter, and I hope you're enjoying my webbed site.

I'm a person (as far as I can tell) and I seem to enjoy doing some things. 
These are include but are not limited to:

- computer programming ‚ú®
- learning about woo stuff üîÆ
- touching moss üçÄ
- connecting with art üé≠

### More Information

Both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are in the field of Computer Science. I have been a lifelong enthusiast of computers, and have a background originally in IT support. For my Masters thesis, I applied ransomware samples to VR headsets. I have spent some time in my education developing theory on reverse engineering. I am familiar with web development, via Python backends and JavaScript frontends. I have also interacted with various SQL-style databases, and some non-relational databases such as MongoDB and DynamoDB. I have spent many years using Unix and Unix-like systems, such as Linux and OSX. I regularly use BASH scripting to accommodate my goals at and away from work. I have spent some time doing embedded C work, predominantly for a IoT medical device at a YC startup. I also dabble in many other fields, but would not particularly consider myself well-versed in them, it's mostly for fun. This includes psychology, biology, philosophy, and esoterica (the weird, the mystical, and the occult). We'll call all that about 5 years of work experience, and many more in formal and informal schooling. 

#### Academics
B.Sc, M.Sc - Computer Science
(*I like da blinkenlights*)

Aside from the pieces of paper, I have spent most of my life Online, and am very well-versed in memes, internet subcultures, conspiracy theories, and all 
other elements of being exposed to the fount of human detritus.

From a young age I have been aware my mind holds information at an astonishing rate and is able to apply it similarly. This has been used for many ends, not all of which were desired and/nor good.

#### Religion
Decidedly not an atheist, not elaborating for now.

#### Formative and Traumatic experiences
Yeah had a few of those, still working that out.

### if you want to send me things
My deepest most unobvious fascination is little indie games on http://itch.io that talk about someone's life experience. Stuff that's deeply real and personal in a way no other production of game can be.

I also like learning about all forms of mysticism, as long as they don't veer into what I would call "mystical escapist world building"

I also like computer history! a lot! it's an old romance for me.

### Contact me
You can drop me an electronic message. This is also the subset of communication most likely to make it to me.
