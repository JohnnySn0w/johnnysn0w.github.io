Hello there! I'm Winter, and I hope you're enjoying my webbed site.

I'm a person (as far as I can tell) and I seem to enjoy doing some things. 
These are include but are not limited to:

- computer programming ‚ú®
- learning about woo stuff üîÆ
- touching moss üçÄ
- connecting with art üé≠

### More Information

My background is certainly a thing.

#### Academics
B.Sc, M.Sc - Computer Science
(*I like da blinkenlights*)

Aside from the pieces of paper, I have spent most of my life Online, and am very well-versed in memes, internet subcultures, conspiracy theories, and all 
other elements of being exposed to the fount of human detritus.

From a young age I have been aware my mind holds information at an astonishing rate and is able to apply it similarly. This has been used for many ends, not all of which were desired and/nor good.

#### Religion
Decidedly not an atheist, not elaborating for now.

#### Formative and Traumatic experiences
Yeah had a few of those, still working that out.

### if you want to send me things
My deepest most unobvious fascination is little indie games on http://itch.io that talk about someone's life experience. Stuff that's deeply real and personal in a way no other production of game can be.

I also like learning about all forms of mysticism, as long as they don't veer into what I would call "mystical escapist world building"

I also like computer history! a lot! it's an old romance for me.

### Contact me
You can drop me an electronic message. This is also the subset of communication most likely to make it to me.
