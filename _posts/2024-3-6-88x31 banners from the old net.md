Yesterday I was scrolling my masto feed, when I spotted [a very interesting boost](https://kolektiva.social/@booters/112039018979714833).

Yes, the user posting it had gone through and scraped the Geocities backup for all of the 88x31pixel banners that were contained therein, and uploaded a sort of museum webpage, hosting all of them. They even did me the favor of posting a link to the de-duplicated zip file. Tiny at ~150MB, considering it holds almost 30,000 files.

That, in combination with a youtube video I recently keyed onto, about the creator's love of really obscure art. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_n_gmINZTI
