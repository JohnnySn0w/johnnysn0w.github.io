Yesterday I was scrolling my  masto feed, when I spotted [a very interesting boost](https://kolektiva.social/@booters/112039018979714833).

Yes, the user posting it had gone through and scraped the geocities backup for all of the 88x31pixel banners that were contained therein, and uploaded a sort of museum webpage, hosting all of them.
