Ok so yesterday, I was like, wow I'm so tired, let me drink coffee this morning(I usually do not). GOD I love coffee. SO that was good.

Come afternoon I was getting pretty ZZZZZZ, so I drank some green tea compliments of the Office. That was also p good.

PROBLEM: I have next to zero caffeine tolerance and what little I do have pales in comparison to how slowly my body metabolizes it.

EFFECT: I was wired up until I crashed circa 12:30 last night 
*for our studio audience and viewers at home, that's 2.5 hrs past my bedtime*

As a side side effect, I [blabbed](https://mastodon.social/@KanekoTheKoolio/110223158070617945) all about how I was [Making Connections](https://mastodon.social/@KanekoTheKoolio/110223597771641825)

A good chunk of ya'll seem enthusiastic to hear, so I have made this blog and continue to channel overcaffeination. Although I am not entirely sure what drives my mania at the moment. Eclipse? lol, lmao even.

I'm kind of a huge damn dabbler, and astrology is on the list. Currently I am trying to be a little more dedicated and internalize the base systems and items. The best way that I do my learning is by looking for the big picture, which is then used as a mnemonic scaffold.  Sometimes this means I have to reverse engineer one from smaller details, but in this there is much joy. 

***I am not claiming some special knowledge, I am really just excited to make mental connections and then blab about them to get critique/affirmation from people. I'm certain that a good bit of what I say here has been said/attempted elsewhere, in so many words.***

So. Houses and signs.

## Part 1: Our house, in the middle of the road

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33181572/233243302-783725da-938b-441c-b601-511ec589b75a.png" title="*our house, it's an oversize load*" alt="*our house, it's an oversize load*" style="width: 300px;"/>


So I'm sitting there, reading the adjectives applied to the houses, as well as looking at how they're separated into quarters. The quarters corresponding to what I would call egoic structures, starting with each Angular house.

- me  
- my family  
- society  
- humanity

The succedent and cadent houses, to me, feel like they are the immediate and tertiary emmanations of the angulars. 

- Angular: the core of a quarter, the base ego structure thing that it pertains to
- Succedent: things that are accessory to or resultant of the angular. In some sense, these are symptoms of the angular's core. 
- Cadent: transitions. These are compounding the first two houses in the quadrant to show how we relate them to the surrounding superstructure. This is in some sense, a transitional house. *For the first quadrant, 3H is tapping into siblings and immediate communications/travel. These things become more foundational in 4h which can be said to be about your immediate vicinity in a household and the people in it.*

In their entirety, the houses are a sequence of increasing levels of effect with concretizing moments, then transitional states.

Since I like my big pictures, I wanted to craft a tool to work as a mental model. I got to wondering after that, what kind of further generalities I could apply to the wheel? So what about the halves?

We get the astro-compass, based on the evergreen political compass:

Cool huh?

The Houses quadrants map like this:

- me  (bout me, right here)
- my family  (about other, right here)
- society  (about other, over there)
- humanity (about me, over there)


I'm still not :100: on the individual houses, but a quick glance feels pretty solid. 


## Part 2: Signs boogaloo

After getting that barely scraped together, I was stricken with a terrible moment of ADHD. I wanted to figure out if I could do some mind mapping with the signs too. Mind you, I've already familiarized myself with triplicities and modes. They weren't really doin' it for me, but they helped.

I looked at the cardinal set first. I shorthanded each:

- aries(impulsivity)
- cancer(guardedness)
- libra(balance)
- capricorn (??? judicious systematizing???)

In the brief moment of seeing the first three, my mind snapped to the thesis-antithesis-synthesis model. The problem comes in that there's a fourth sign there. So how do I work that out?

*dialectically*!ðŸ¤­

At this point it was late and I honestly felt a little frizzed, but still going full speed. So I asked someone else to be my brain and work it out. ChatGPT-4 obliged. Through some back n forth, the conclusion was drawn that, yeah you can *kinda* fit the modalities into that model, but the fourth thing you might want to add is akin to Realizing/actualizing.

The hegelian thesis/antithesis/synthesis model works somewhat if you consider the 4th sign for each modality to be the effecting of the synthesis to a context that tracks with that modality, which tracks with my wackadoo astro-politicompass. The final part is to Actualize, so for pisces, its closer to the About Me side of things, but also on the Out There, it's about personal integration, but in no small part how the integration begins to affect others.

AND honestly, upsettingly, *it still doesn't super work*

I can tell you for the cardinal signs:

| Sign	|	Model component		|	Trait	|
| ---|---|---|
| Aries |Thesis|Impulse|
| Cancer|Antithesis|Caution|
| Libra|Synthesis|Balancing impulses while remaining guarded where necessary|
| Capricorn | Realization | turning ideas into reality through hard work, persistence, and organization, which requires balancing MANY things of varying priorities|

I definitely to call the last quadrant transcendant or something along those lines. But again, the mapping doesn't map as well as I'd like.


Dazed, I asked the local AI chatbot what it thought about [Kegan stages 1-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_developmental_framework#Stages_of_adult_development) and the sign quadrants. This is a better mapping.


| Kegan Stage | Stage Name           | Zodiac Quadrant | Associated Signs    |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Stage 1     | Impulsive Mind       | First Quarter   | Aries, Taurus, Gemini     |
| Stage 2     | Imperial Mind        | Second Quarter  | Cancer, Leo, Virgo        |
| Stage 3     | Interpersonal Mind   | Third Quarter   | Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius |
| Stage 4     | Institutional Mind   | Fourth Quarter  | Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces  |

The mapping holds to the egoic structures from earlier, and fits pretty alright.

Now, you might be wondering "what ab kegan 5"
Well, I dunno man, you tell me, how do u think kegan 5 fits here? I'm going to persist being cheeky ab this, but your conclusion is probably mine.

Something about having more than one finger to point at celestial objects with.

## Part 3: finally

Remember how at the beginning I linked to a twitter thread? It's finally relevant. Mickey's Chekhov is firing directly into your neurons.

My last foray for the night was trying to map the egregirls thread meta-concept of person/pattern/system based thinking types. Honestly, great model, one of my favorites.

This is what the LLM had to generate ab that idea:

So yeah, that's pretty neat, and it also kinda feels like it helps my semi-failed hegelian attempt from earlier.



:shrug:

janky abstract connections are fun

For my next trick, I'll show how the cardinal scales of my astro politocompass map to the jungian conscious/unsconscious left/right brain model...or not...(for now)

I'm going to keep having zany little connection moments like this, and my only hope is that I take more time to flesh them out, rather than dumping a blog post like this, before dumping them into a blog post like this. But uh, track records n all that.


May you find some worth in my words. May you be well.

**Toodles!**
